Android-Demos-1
===============

This is the first in a progressively more difficult series of demos 
for Android development that focuses on the basics. Along with CalmlyCoding.com 
blog posts, these demos are designed to teach beginning developers 
how to get started with Android.

This particular Demo contains three main parts:

Part 1. Switching between activities and changing view values
Part 2. Persisting data and passing it between activities
Part 3. Using fragments to show different UI layouts based on portrait and landscape views.

-Note- The development tutorial for this demo hasn't been posted on calmlycoding.com yet, but this README will be
updated when each post is created.
